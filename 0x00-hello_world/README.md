# PROJECT: 0x00-hello_world
 This project is a collection of scripts and programs in the C language that aim to solve some of problems.

## Overview:
This project is broken down into six different parts, each with a specific problem to solve. They are as follows:

1- Preprocessor : A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
2- Compiler : A script that compiles a C file but does not link.
3- Assembler : A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.
4- Name : A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named "cisfun".
5- Hello, puts : A C program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line, without using printf.
6- Hello, printf : A C program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line, using printf.

In addition to these specific problems, there is a program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

## Tools Used :
C Language
GCC Compiler
Betty linter
 
## Conclusion: 
This project test the developer's skillset in C programming, exploring different aspects of the language such as the preprocessor, compiler, assembler and printf functions. As part of this project, various programs and bash scripts were created to solve specific problems.
